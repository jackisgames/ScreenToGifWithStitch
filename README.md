# Screen To Gif With Stitch Feature
Unofficial ScreenToGif with stitch feature

I need to combine 2 gifs together for my work. Original Screen2Gif is missing that feature and i dont really like the idea of switching app.
So it put together the missing feature needed for my purpose over the weekend. 

Features:
- Merge / Combine multiple gifs
- Retain original frame rate of each gifs
- Editable & export to new gif
